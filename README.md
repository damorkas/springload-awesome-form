##  Done

*  Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
*  Implemented given form in React framework.
*  Added necessary validations as per requirements.
*  Wrote few tests for the components.

##  TODO

*  Add `TypeScript` to the project. At this stage it seemed like an overkill to use it but thinking about bigger scope applications I would use `TypeScript`.

*  Write more reliable tests for generating components and form validation logic. Also, maybe include `snapshot` testing with `Jest` or etc.

* Add error messages for better user experience. 
* Fix error styling for `Colour`, `Animal`. 
* Try to think more about errors handling:
	* should it be on input change or form submit
	* should remove error message when trying to fix error or not
